# Output must be valid Rasa 3.x YAML with English identifiers; no markdown fences.

I have dialogues from a spoken dialogue system involving interactions between the system and users. I need to extract the Rasa file **nlu.yml**.

nlu.yml
1. Extract intents from the dialogues and list example utterances for each intent.
2. Identify entities mentioned in the dialogues and provide examples of entity values.
3. Ensure each entity is consistently associated with the correct intents.

Please process the following dialogues and generate **only** nlu.yml enclosed in ```yaml fences.
